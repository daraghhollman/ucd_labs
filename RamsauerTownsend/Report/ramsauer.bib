abstract={The anomalously small scattering of electrons near 1 eV energy by noble gas atoms may be easily demonstrated using a 2D21 xenon thyratron. This experiment is suitable for a lecture demonstration or for an undergraduate physics laboratory. The probability of scattering and the scattering cross section may be obtained as a function of electron energy by measuring the grid and plate currents in the tube.},
