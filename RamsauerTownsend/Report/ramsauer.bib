abstract={The anomalously small scattering of electrons near 1 eV energy by noble gas atoms may be easily demonstrated using a 2D21 xenon thyratron. This experiment is suitable for a lecture demonstration or for an undergraduate physics laboratory. The probability of scattering and the scattering cross section may be obtained as a function of electron energy by measuring the grid and plate currents in the tube.},

volume={39},

pages={558-560},
abstract={An experiment on the Ramsauer-Townsend effect in xenon using a 2D21 thyratron, which was originally devised by Kukolich, has been extended to allow for effects due to contact potential and electron emission energy. As well as improving the accuracy of the experiment, this extension serves as a useful method of introducing the concepts of contact potential and electron energy distribution.},
