abstract = {Compton scattering is widely used to analyse electron momentum distributions in solid state systems. Perhaps less well-known is its role as the major cause of image contrast in medical and industrial radiography. This article discusses the principles and applications of a technique, known as Compton scatter imaging (CSI), which is based on direct registration of the Compton scatter radiation. Following a historical survey of the major developments in this field, the strengths and weaknesses of transmission radiography and Compton scatter imaging are compared in order to determine those measurement situations to which the latter is best suited. A description is given of several disturbing effects to which CSI is prone and ways in which these may be accounted for to yield quantitative density data are presented. The most important types of imaging system based on Compton scatter are discussed and compared. The ComScan (an acronym for Compton scatter scanner) is a commercially-available backscatter imaging system which is discussed here in some detail. ComScan images taken from applications of topical and historical interest are presented.}

abstract={In 1928, Klein and Nishina investigated Compton scattering based on the Dirac equation just proposed in the same year, and derived the Klein–Nishina formula for the scattering cross section of a photon. At that time the Dirac equation had the following unsettled conceptual questions: the negative energy states, its four-component wave functions, and the spin states of an electron. Hence, during their investigation struggles, they encountered various difficulties. In this article, we describe their struggles to derive the formula using the “Sangokan Nishina Source Materials” retained in the the Nishina Memorial Foundation.},

abstract = {We have developed a quasi-monochromatic hard X-ray source via laser Compton scattering (LCS) based on an S-band compact electron linac at AIST. The number of total photons and the maximum X-ray energy was 107photons/sec and about 40keV, respectively, in 15-degree crossing angle between a 42MeV electron beam and a 800nm Ti:Sa laser. The biological observation of the human bone with fractures has been successfully demonstrated using the LCS X-ray of 26.4keV with the in-line phase contrast scheme. Good contrast enhancement is clearly observed between the absorption and the phase contrast images.}
