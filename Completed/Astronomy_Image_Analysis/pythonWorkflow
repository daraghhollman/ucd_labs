Data reduction:

Read in the pixel values of each bias into an np array. Find the average value of each pixel across all bias frames. Assign each average pixel to a new file: masterBias.fits

Subtract the pixel values of the masterbias from each flat frame, saving them as new files bFlat_01.fits
Note this must be done on a pixel by pixel basis.

As before, combine these bFlats to make a masterflat. This must be normalised by diving by the average pixel value in the centre of the array and should have a value of 1 in the centre of the field of view.

This will need to be done for each filter: B, V, Halpha, and clear.

After this we should have 5 files:
	- masterBias.fits
	- nMasterFlat_B.fits
	- nMasterFlat_V.fits
	- nMasterFlat_Ha.fits
	- nMasterFlat_C.fits
	
With these files we will be able to reduce our images by subtracting the masterBias and dividing by the masterFlat, saving the result as a new file in the Output folder.

OPTIONAL: Upload images to nova.astrometry.net to find the WCS of the image.

Analysis:

Aim is to measure the brightness of a source in the image -> Aperture Photometry, using astropy photoutils
