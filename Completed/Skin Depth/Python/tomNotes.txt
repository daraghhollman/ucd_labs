Tom's Crypic Notes

Asking why something odd happens at high frequency.
Skin depth decreases, charges move towards the surface of the sample.
This creates a potential / electric field in addition to the one from the solenoid.

Definately bring up the work put in to calculate voltage error.
Speak about the annomalies in the data.
