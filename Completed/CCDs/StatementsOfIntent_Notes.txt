What is the aim of the experiment?
The aim of the experiment is to familiarise the student with the function of a CCD for spectroscopy. This is done by comparing the spectrum of an arc lamp to reference values.

What measurements will be made and how?
Measure the readnoise and gain for the CCD
Spectrum of the arc lamp to calobrate spectrograph

How will the final resuilt be obtained from the experimental data?
The arc spectrum will be plotted and compared to known wavelengths

What are the amin safety conerns with the experiment and precautions that should be taken?
Working with electronics and delicate equipment so care and precision is needed.
