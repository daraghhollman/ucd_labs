SURFACE PLASMONS NOTES

Aim: 
- To calculate the dispersion relation for the surface plasmon.
- To calculate the reflectivty due to the excitation of this normal mode.
- Angle of plasmon extinction.
- Dependence on wavelength and thickenss

FROM METAL SURFACES LIGHT UP:
	Free electrons create surface waves called plasmons when in the visible domain.
	- Oscillations in the density of the free electrons. (<20 nm from the surface of a thin metal film)

	EM field due to the oscilations, dampens over time, losing energy in the form of heat.

	INTRODCUTION
